# Hangman Game
This repository contains a simple text-based Hangman game implemented in Python. The objective of the game is to guess a secret phrase, one character at a time. You have a limited number of lives, and each incorrect guess reduces your remaining lives by one. If you run out of lives before guessing the phrase, you lose the game. If you successfully guess the entire phrase, you win!

## Features
Accepts user input for guessing characters in the secret phrase
Tracks and displays the number of remaining lives
Displays the current state of the guessed phrase, with underscores for unguessed characters
Supports case-insensitive input
Supports characters and whitespace in the secret phrase


## How to Run
To run the Hangman game, simply execute the Python script using Python 3:
If you're using cmd + promt, --> cd to the file location and type:
python3 file_name.py (ex.: python3 hangman.py)

And the game should run -- Have fun
